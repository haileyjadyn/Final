The factorial SDT model quantified how the stimulus complexity and trail difficulty impacted both participant's sensitivity (d') and response bias. The results of this model demonstrated that the trial difficulty had a strong and reliable effect on performance. When trials were harder, sensitivity significantly decreased and participants became more conservative in their responses. However, the stimulus complexity had a smaller and less certain effect on sensitivityand its influence on response bias was sllight. These findings suggest trial difficulty is a stronger determinant of participant's ability to distinguish signals from noise and plays a more influential role in shaping their decision-making thresholds. 

The delta plots provided another perspective by illustrating how trial difficulty and stimulus complexity influenced response times across the conditions. Hard trials produced larger differences in response time distributions, espectially for accurate responses. This indicates a greater cognitive load and decision conflict under increased difficulty. This pattern adds to the SDT findings of reduced sensitivyt in difficult conditions. Complex stimuli also resulted in longer response times, however the effect was less dramatic and more uniform across all response types, which is consistent with the minimal impact demonstrated in the SDT model. 

Together, these two models emphasize that trial difficulty impairs accuracy as well as speed. Stimulus complexiity primarily slows performance without strongly altering detection or decision criteria. This analysis demonstrates how SDT and delta plots can togehter reveal nuaced patterns in perceptual decision making.
